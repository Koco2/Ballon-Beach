# Ballon-Beach

This game is made in Unity3D. I follow the tutorial from David McDonald, so it is not my original design. I made this game just to explore more about creating games. In the game, users need to control the red ball to dog obstacles and move forward. It is a perfect game for toilet time ^ _ ^
